# Greenhouse Automation Project

## Overview

This greenhouse automation project is powered by a PIC18F46K20 microcontroller and incorporates three main sensors for intelligent greenhouse control. The project aims to create an efficient and environmentally friendly cultivation system.

## Sensors

1. **TC74 Temperature Sensor**
   - Provides real-time temperature control with automatic fan regulation.

2. **LDR Light Sensor**
   - Adjusts the light intensity based on the plant's growth requirements.

3. **HS1101 Soil Moisture Sensor**
   - Ensures plants receive adequate water by automatically activating the water pump. Note: A Variable Resistor and LC circuit were used in the simulation for the soil moisture sensor.
