Greenhouse Automation Project

This project is powered by a PIC18F46K20 microcontroller and integrates three main sensors for smart greenhouse control:

1- TC74 Temperature Sensor: real-time control with automatic fan control.

2- LDR Light Sensor: Adjust the light according to plant growth.

3- HS1101 Soil Moisture Sensor: Ensure plants receive enough water by automatically activating the water pump. 
(Not ideal sensor but the principle should be functional)

Note: In the design I resorted to use Variable Resistor and LC circuit to the soil moisture sensor for the sake of simulation

The perfect solution for efficient and environmentally friendly cultivation.
